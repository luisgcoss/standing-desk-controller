# Todo

## First version

- [x] get good data from desk encoder
- [x] handle buttons press and long press
- [x] save encoder position efficiently (only when the desk stops moving and only once)
- [ ] save desk position on long press
- [ ] move desk on short press
- [ ] cancel desk movement if a button is pressed
- [ ] calibrate mode
  - [x] handle calibration states
  - [ ] calibrate no mather what position was storted first
  - [ ] add calibration mode (difference between no calibrated and calibration mode)
- [x] led to add semantic
- [ ] make the led blink to add semantic

## Perfomance

- [ ] Reduce variables
- [ ] Separation of concerns by files

## IoT version

- [ ] research to find info about how to send actions to arduino trought wifi
